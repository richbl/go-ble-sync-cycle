**BLE Sync Cycle** is a Go application designed to synchronize video playback with real-time cycling data from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, such as cycling speed and cadence (CSC) sensors. This integration provides users with a more immersive indoor cycling experience by matching video playback speed with their actual cycling pace, making it a great option when outdoor cycling isn't feasible.
