**BLE Sync Cycle** can be run in two distinct modes: GUI or CLI.

In GUI (graphical user interface) mode, the application is started and run like any other graphical application. Some benefits of running in GUI mode include:

- Easy to start
- Easy to visually track video progression during a cycling session
- Real-time logging is available directly within the application interface
- Easy to manage and edit BSC sessions

In CLI (command line interface) mode, the application is started from the command line within a terminal. Some benefits of running in CLI mode include:

- Easy to run the application with optional configuration flags
- Easy to view logging in real-time (outputs to `stdout`)
- Easy to shutdown the application (CTRL+C, which sends a `SIGINT` signal to the application)
