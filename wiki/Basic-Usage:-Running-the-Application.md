After starting `ble-sync-cycle`, you should see the following output. Note that the output below was generated when `logging_level` was set to `debug` in the `config.toml` file.

```console

```

In this first example (above), while the application was able to find the BLE peripheral, it failed to discover the CSC services and characteristics before timing out. Depending on the BLE peripheral, it may take some time before a BLE peripheral advertises both its services and characteristics. If the peripheral is not responding, you may need to increase the timeout in the `config.toml` file. In most cases however, rerunning the application will resolve the issue.

```

In the next example (above), the application found the peripheral CSC and battery services and characteristics and is now running in a loop, listening to the BLE peripheral for speed data. The application will also update the playback speed of the media player to match the speed of the sensor. Here, since the video has just begun, its speed is set to 0.0 (paused).

```

In this last example, **BLE Sync Cycle** is coordinating with both the BLE peripheral (the speed sensor) and the video player, updating the video player to match the speed of the sensor.

**To quit the application, press `Ctrl+C`.**
