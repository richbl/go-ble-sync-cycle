This project was developed to address a specific need:

**How can I continue cycling when the weather outside is not ideal?**

While there are several existing solutions that allow for virtual indoor cycling, such as [Zwift](https://www.zwift.com/) and [Rouvy](https://rouvy.com/), these typically require the purchase of specialized training equipment (often preventing the use of your own bike), a subscription to compatible online virtual cycling services, and a reliable broadband Internet connection.

My needs are different:

- I want to train _using my own bicycle_. Since I prefer riding recumbents, it wouldnâ€™t make sense for me to train on a traditional upright trainer
- I need a solution that can function with minimal dependencies and without requiring an Internet connection, as I live in a rural part of the Pacific Northwest where both electricity and Internet services can be unreliable

> Check out my [**Watchfile Remote [Rust Edition] project**](https://github.com/richbl/rust-watchfile-remote) for an example of how I handle our regular loss of Internet service here in the woods of the Pacific Northwest

- Finally, I want flexibility in the solutions and components that I use, as I typically like to tweak the systems I work with. I suspect it's my nature as an engineer to tinker.

Since I already use an analog bicycle trainer while riding indoors, it made sense for me to find a way to pair my existing Bluetooth cycling sensors with a local computer which could then drive some kind of interesting video feedback while cycling. This project was created to fit that need.
