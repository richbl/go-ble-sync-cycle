**BLE Sync Cycle** relies on either of two external media player libraries for video playback:

- The [mpv](https://mpv.io/) media player
- The [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc) media player

One or both players can be used, but the following software libraries must also be installed for each player (in addition to the players themselves):

For mpv:

1. Install the `libmpv2` library:

    ```console
    sudo apt-get install libmpv2
    ```

For VLC:

1. Install the `libvlc-dev` library:

    ```console
    sudo apt-get install libvlc-dev
    ```
