1. Clone the repository and then change into the project directory:

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/richbl/go-ble-sync-cycle
    cd go-ble-sync-cycle
    ```

2. Install Go package dependencies for the project:

    ```console
    go mod download
    ```

3. Build the application:

    ```console
    go build -o ble-sync-cycle cmd/*
    ```

The resulting `build` command will compile the`ble-sync-cycle` executable in the current directory.

#### GTK4/Adwaita Integration

For releases made after the integration of the graphical user interface (GUI), additional package dependencies have been introduced to incorporate GTK4/Adwaita libraries regardless of whether the application is run via command-line or as a GUI application. These packages require a one-time compilation cycle, which can take ~15-20 minutes to complete. The package used by the Go language for managing C-based sources is called [`cgo`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo).

As of this writing, a number of runtime warnings are generated by the `cgo` package which can visually interfere with the application output. If it's desired to suppress these compiler package warnings, be sure to set the following environment variable before building the application:

```console
export CGO_CFLAGS="-w"
go build -o ble-sync-cycle cmd/*
```

> Note that this export is not required for a successful build: it simply removes any external package warnings from being displayed when running the`ble-sync-cycle` executable
