1. Clone the repository and then change into the project directory:

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/richbl/go-ble-sync-cycle
    cd go-ble-sync-cycle
    ```

2. Install Go package dependencies for the project:

    ```console
    go mod download
    ```

3. Build the application:

    ```console
    go build -o ble-sync-cycle cmd/*
    ```

The resulting `build` command will compile the`ble-sync-cycle` executable in the current directory.

#### GTK4/Adwaita Integration

In order for the application to run with the option for a graphical user interface (GUI), two additional GTK4/Adwaita package dependencies are needed:

- [The GoTK4 project](https://github.com/diamondburned/gotk4)
- [The GoTK4-Adwaita project](https://github.com/diamondburned/gotk4-adwaita)

##### WARNING:  Slow Compilation Times Ahead

While these packages will get installed automatically during project setup (above), they require a one-time C-based compilation, **which can take ~15-20 minutes to complete**. Please be patient.

> For the curious, the package used by the Go language for managing C-based sources--such as those used in the GTK4 projects above--is called [`cgo`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo).

#### Optional: Managing Cgo Runtime Warnings

As of this writing, a number of runtime warnings are generated by the `cgo` package which can visually interfere with the application runtime/logging output. If it's desired to suppress these compiler package warnings, be sure to set the following environment variable before building the application:

```console
export CGO_CFLAGS="-w"
go build -o ble-sync-cycle cmd/*
```

Note that this export is not required for a successful build: it simply removes any external package warnings from being displayed when running the`ble-sync-cycle` executable
