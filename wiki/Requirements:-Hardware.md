### A Bicycle

- A bicycle set up for indoor cycling (usually mounted on a trainer)

### A Computer

- A computer that supports Bluetooth (4.0+), preferably with a large flat screen display to watch video playback

For my own indoor cycling configuration, I use a Performance Travel Trac 3 fluid trainer. The BLE sensor used is a [Magene S3+ Speed/Cadence Dual Mode Sensor](https://www.magene.com/en/sensors/59-s3-speed-cadence-dual-mode-sensor.html) configured for speed, though any BLE-compliant sensor should work.

### A BLE Cycling Sensor

- A Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Cycling Speed and Cadence (CSC) sensor, configured for speed
