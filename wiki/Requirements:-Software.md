### A Go Environment

- In order to compile the executable for this project, an operational [Go language](https://go.dev/) environment is required (this release was developed using Go 1.25.x). Once the **BLE Sync Cycle** application is compiled into an executable, it can be run without dependencies on the Go development environment

### A Media Player

- The open source, cross-platform [mpv media player](https://mpv.io/), installed (e.g., `sudo apt-get install mpv`) and operational
    - Additionally, the `libmpv2` library (API) must be installed (e.g., `sudo apt-get install libmpv2`)

  OR

- The open source, cross-platform [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc), installed (e.g., `sudo apt-get install vlc`) and operational
    - Additionally, the`libvlc-dev` library (API) must be installed (e.g., `sudo apt-get install libvlc-dev`)

### A First-Person View Cycling Video

- A local video file for playback, preferably a first-person view cycling video. Check out [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com), [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com), or [DailyMotion](https://www.dailymotion.com/us), and search for "first person cycling" or "POV cycling" for some great ideas

### The Target Platform

- While **BLE Sync Cycle** has been written and tested using Ubuntu 24.04 and25.10 on AMD and Intel processors, it should work across any comparable Unix-like platform and architecture
