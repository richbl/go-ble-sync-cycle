**BLE Sync Cycle** was inspired by indoor cycling training needs, the amazing first-person view cycling videos from around the world found on YouTube and elsewhere, and the desire to bring these two elements together.

Some special thanks are in order:

- The [TinyGo Go Bluetooth package maintainers](https://github.com/tinygo-org/bluetooth) for making BLE device integration in Go relatively straight forward

- The [the Diamondburned team](https://github.com/Diamondburned) for their work on GTK4/Adwaita bindings for Go. I relied heavily on both the [GoTK4](https://github.com/diamondburned/gotk4) and the [GoTK4-Adwaita](https://github.com/diamondburned/gotk4-adwaita) projects when developing the GUI for this project

- The [Gen2Brain team for developing go-mpv](https://github.com/gen2brain/go-mpv), which provides access to the [mpv media player](https://mpv.io/) via their Go package

- The [contirbutors of the libvlc-go project](https://github.com/adrg/libvlc-go), which made the integration of the [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc) media player possible

- To Kevin Townsend for a very useful and comprehensive overview of Bluetooth BLE. His article is ["Introduction to Bluetooth Low Energy"](https://learn.adafruit.com/introduction-to-bluetooth-low-energy/introduction)
