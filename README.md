## Overview

**BLE Sync Cycle** is a Go application designed to synchronize video playback with real-time cycling data from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, such as cycling speed and cadence (CSC) sensors. This integration provides users with a more immersive indoor cycling experience by matching video playback speed with their actual cycling pace, making it a great option when outdoor cycling isn't feasible.

## Features

* Real-time synchronization of cycling speed and video playback

* Supports compliant BLE Cycling Speed and Cadence (CSC) sensors (in speed mode)

* Integrates with [mpv](https://mpv.io) and [VLC](https://www.videolan.org) media players

* Highly configurable TOML-based config file for:
    * BLE sensor address (BD\_ADDR) and scan timeout
    * Wheel circumference (for accurate speed)
    * Speed units (mph or km/h)
    * Speed smoothing for natural playback
    * Video file selection
    * Display options:
        * On-screen display (OSD) for speed and time remaining
        * Video window scaling (fullscreen, etc.)
        * OSD position and font size

* Command-line interface for real-time application status

* CLI flags to override settings:
    * Configuration file path (allows for multiple profiles)
    * Video start time (seek)
    * Help/usage information

* Configurable log levels (debug, info, warn, error)

* On every application startup, the battery level of the BLE sensor is checked and displayed

* Graceful handling of connection interrupts and system signals for a clean shutdown

## Rationale

This project was developed to address a specific need: **how can I continue cycling when the weather outside is less than ideal?**

While there are several existing solutions that allow for "virtual" indoor cycling, such as [Zwift](https://www.zwift.com/) and [Rouvy](https://rouvy.com/), these typically require the purchase of specialized training equipment (often preventing the use of your own bike), a subscription to compatible online virtual cycling services, and a reliable broadband Internet connection.

My needs are different:

* I want to train _using my own bicycle_. Since I prefer riding recumbents, it wouldnâ€™t make sense for me to train on a traditional upright trainer
* I need a solution that can function with minimal dependencies and without requiring an Internet connection, as I live in a rural part of the Pacific Northwest where both electrical and Internet services are unreliable

> Check out my [**Watchfile Remote [Rust Edition] project**](https://github.com/richbl/rust-watchfile-remote) for an example of how I handle our regular loss of Internet service here in the woods of the Pacific Northwest

* Finally (and importantly), I want flexibility in the solutions and components that I use, as I typically like to tweak the systems I work with. Call me crazy, but I suspect it's my nature as an engineer to tinker...

Since I already use an analog bicycle trainer while riding indoors, it made sense for me to find a way to pair my existing Bluetooth cycling sensors with a local computer which could then drive some kind of interesting feedback while cycling. This project was created to fit that need.
